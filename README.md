podcast-timer
=============

A very simple Java GUI for timing podcasts (generating chapter marks). Released under the MIT license.

Usage
-----

At the moment this really is as simple as it gets:
1. Press the "Start Timer" button as you start recording your podcast.
2. Press the "Enter Chapter" button when a new chapter starts.
3. A dialog will pop up, asking you for a chapter title.
4. Enjoy your chapters!

Chapter format
--------------

The chapter marks follow this format:
hh:mm:ss.000 Chapter 1
hh:mm:ss.000 Chapter 2

The advantage of this format is that it is understood by http://auphonic.com which I use for podcast postproduction.
